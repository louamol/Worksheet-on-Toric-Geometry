\part{Beyond the D-brane probes constructions}

    There are mainly three methods of constructing finite supersymmetric gauge theories from string theory:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Geometrical engineering
        \item D-branes probing singularities
        \item Hanany-Witten setups.
    \end{enumerate}
